Neural Voice Cloning
Voice cloning is a highly desired feature for personalized speech interfaces. Neural network-based speech synthesis has been shown to generate high quality speech for many speakers.
While the complete training of a single-speaker TTS model is technically a form of voice cloning, the interest rather lies in creating a fixed model able to incorporate newer voices with little data. 
The common approach is to condition a TTS model trained to generalize to new speakers on an embedding of the voice to clone.
